# Fasting

I practice intermittent fasting, meaning I only eat during one window in each day. I do an 8-16 split, where my first meal is around noon and my last food is around 8pm. 

I've done one 3-day water fast so far and would like to do it again, it was great.

I need to collect more concrete resources on fasting, most of my information is second hand from people like Tim Ferris and Peter Attia. Broadly though I have enjoyed the following benefits:

* More regular energy throughout the day
* Better understanding of the relationship between certain foods and mood
* Increased lean mass with minimal body fat
  * Even gaining lean mass without increasing body fat noticeably
