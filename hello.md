# 👋 Hello!

Hi, welcome to my notes.

This is basically a public repository of things I've learned, collected or found interesting enough to write down but that aren't suitable for blog posts. None of this is presented as fact or even recommendation, merely my personal views and interests. This is all a perpetual work-in-progress, I'm attempting to be raw and learn openly.

Broadly, you'll find here:

* Philosophy, in the "how to live a good life" sense
* Emotional wellbeing
* Meditation 
* Programming
* Video Games
* How to get shit done
* Efficiency
* Minimalism
* Essentialism
* Art and creation
* Health
* Exercise
* General scientific inquiry

These resources helped me chart my course from a shy, sad, anxious and lost little boy to a proud, stable, happy adult. I provide no guarantees they will do the same for you, but there's a chance.

Please let me know of any resources you think I might like after poking around here 😁
