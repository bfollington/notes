## Hot Takes

1. Typescript is better than Javascript
2. The Cascading part of CSS is a mistake
3. CSS-in-JS \(a.k.a. CSS-in-TS\) is good

5. Immutability and purity are essential
6. Redux is irrelevant
7. GraphQL is good
8. Approaches like redux-thunk and redux-saga are an anti-pattern
9. Typescript should just add support for pattern matching and `|>`
