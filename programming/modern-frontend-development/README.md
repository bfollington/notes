# Modern Frontend Development

## Hot Takes

1. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is better than Javascript
2. [The Cascading part of CSS is a mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniwPUEbPUM)
3. [CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) \(a.k.a. CSS-in-TS\) is good
4. Style overrides are almost never good
5. Immutability and purity are essential
6. [Redux is mostly irrelevant](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)
7. GraphQL is cool
8. [Approaches like redux-thunk and redux-saga are an anti-pattern](https://github.com/bfollington/use-stream)
9. Typescript should just add support for pattern matching and `|>` 
10. Semicolons suck
11. If you've gotta use CSS, use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
