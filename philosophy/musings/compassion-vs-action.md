# Compassion vs Action

There is a distinction between being compassionate for someone, for being there for them when they need it and being responsible for alleviating their suffering.

Love is being there, love is not "doing anything" to make it better.

Focusing on alleviation of suffering is a fallacy, it cannot be stopped forever.
