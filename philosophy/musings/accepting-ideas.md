# Accepting Ideas

We are unable to accept ideas that we find distasteful. So a large part of philosophy is not just having an idea, but finding a way for that idea to sit well with you. The insignificance of man is not an appealing concept until we reframe it in the context of one universal entity.

Much of education is about framing an idea so it can be received rather than just delivering the idea.

Perhaps a successful idea is one that can be easily taken on board because it is made easily appealing?
