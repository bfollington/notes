# Overthinking

Overthinking is a misleading term, it implies that more thinking is always bad. Overthinking typically refers to _pointless_ thinking or rumination. I have found that applying more thought and deliberate intellectual rigour to my life has been continuously rewarding. 

It may sound stressful, but it really isn't. Thinking things through in advance is a great mitigator for future stress.
