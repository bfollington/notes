# Growth and Chaos

Shock leads to growth.

A raging fire destroys all in its path, and yet in its wake new sprouts appear.

Chaos may be unpleasant to experience but it tears away our comfort. It gives us a chance to reassemble the pieces in a way that's suitable for who we are now, rather than who we were.
