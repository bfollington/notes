# Wholesale Ideology

One should never adopt wholesale the philosophy of anyone else. At best, this is intellectually lazy and at worst leads to no less than ideological warfare and bloodshed. When we stop thinking for ourselves we make ideologies the backbone of our identity. In turn, when confronted with an opinion that contrasts with our own the very core of our identity is threatened and we respond with fear. Instead if we hold many beliefs and ideas with a gentle touch we are free to invite more in and release old beliefs without distress.
