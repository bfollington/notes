# Addiction

Addiction is acceptable on the following conditions:

* You can admit it without shame
* You take scheduled / regular breaks
* You truly appreciate the value it brings to your life and believe that value outweighs the cost
* You acknowledge the control it has over you
* It does not lead you to neglect other aspects of your life
