# The Identity Problem

Why being an individual isn't all it's meant to be.  


* Expressing oneself is good
* Determining your worth from your individuality is bad
* Freedom from judgement
* Accepting yourself &gt; admiring yourself
* You will change, you shouldn't fight it
* Instead watch and understand the changes as they come
* You are not one identity, you are hundreds of competing ones
