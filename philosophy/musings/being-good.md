# Being "Good"

You don't need to dedicate your entire life to fixing the world, instead choose to live it in an ethical way you wish others could follow.

Choose projects that enrich people's lives and provide value and conduct them honestly and transparently.

Aim to share knowledge with others about how you've learned to live.

Support initiatives and projects you believe in publicly and vocally to help spread the word.
