# Mission Statement

To give others a sense of understanding about their insecurities and trauma, ultimately leading them to accept themselves and find contentment.

This likely comes from my own desire to be understood and included. This is what my younger self needed, to hear that they were still normal. That you can learn to overcome and accept any of your most disliked qualities.
