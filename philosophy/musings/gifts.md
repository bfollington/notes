# Gifts

All things in life are given to you, they cannot be taken by force. However, you must make yourself ready to receive them before you can actually accept the gift. Be thankful when you receive the gift, know your have earned it but that you were not entitled to it. For every just success you have there may be an equivalently unjust failure.
