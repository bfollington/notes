# Consistency

It should not bother us that we are inconsistent, or that we have thoughts that are undesirable. There is no avoiding this since you cannot control yourself. In many ways this perspective is an antidote to shame.

Obviously, at times, shame is critically important but when taking this view it becomes a choice rather than a curse... If you have any experience with that voice in your head screaming that you'll never be anywhere near good enough then I'm sure you can relate.
