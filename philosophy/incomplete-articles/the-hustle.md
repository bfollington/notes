# The Hustle

The cycle:

* Envision the ideal structure of my life
  * Work when I want, as much or little as I want
  * Minimalist, small house, grow some of my own food
  * Meditate, learn, socialise, laugh, listen to music, create
  * Exercise
  * Variety in each day
  * Freedom
* What do I need?
  * Money, passive income
* How do I get it?
  * Start a company
  * Release a hit game
  * Invest and be smart with my money
* Pitfalls
  * I can't actually bring myself to start a company that doesn't help people and that I'm not passionate about
  * If I focus too much on this type of success, then I will be moving further away from my ideal
* So, seems like the only way is what I'm doing right?
  * Work for someone else
  * Make fulfilling side projects with the hope that eventually one of them can lead me to being financially independent
* The problem is, this leaves me very time-poor
  * Constantly stressing that I could be doing _more_
  * Hard to relax and turn off with friends and loved ones
* Current plan is to save enough money to coast for a few years and give myself a real run at doing what I want full-time
