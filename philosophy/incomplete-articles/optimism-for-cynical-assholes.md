# Optimism for Cynical Assholes

* I have always been very negative
* I found optimism and wholesomeness cringe inducing and trite
* We don't want to be openly positive for fear of judgement from others
  * "Oh, you're one of _those_ people"
* Or for fear of rejection, for them not reciprocating
* How fucked up is it that we are scared of being judged for being happy? Of being judged for caring about someone?
* I have always had trouble expressing my affection for partners, family and friends
  * Sometimes I would feel like I should say something but I was paralyzed by fear of looking "stupid" while doing it
  * It may not look like it, but sharing your happiness and compassion takes immense courage
* ... more about having trouble opening up, anecdotes etc.
* Some people find this distasteful because they see the world as a cruel and unforgiving where you must _earn_ your place
* Sure, whatever, the world is cruel and doesn't care about you
* Isn't that a strong argument _for_ being positive?
* I doubt many of us will get to the end of our lives and think "I am _so_ glad that I remained cynical the whole way, it really made it all worthwhile"

We're playing a bigger game here, it's not just about how you feel but about how you _could_ feel.

* Let's say you're actually open to the idea of being positive, what steps can you take?
* Affirmations
* Gratitude practices
* Appreciating the little things
* Notes on **how** you can fight the voice in your head that tells you "this is dumb I wanna stop"
