When we tell people our fantastic ideas, we are often confused when they push back on them. What's your problem? This idea is perfectly thought out, immaculate in its conception!

See when we talk, we like to think it's a process of:

```text
Person A -> Words describing idea perfectly -> Person B
```

The problem here is several fold. Firstly, words don't actually have the exact same meaning to Person A and Person B, which often leads to us saying things like "What exactly do you _mean_ when you say climate change is a hoax?", thinly veiling our rage. 

_/\* Insert explanation of Idea -&gt; Words -&gt; Sounds -&gt; Words -&gt; Ideas model \*/_

What makes matters worse though is that it doesn't end here.

Well, it turns out ideas have a little baggage with them. Sometimes quite a lot. An idea is not an atomic thing, it cannot be cleanly separated from its related siblings in your brain. 

So when we go through this bizarre translation process, the idea gets to the other end and just... Bounces off.

_\(Jigsaw puzzle piece not fitting\)_

For an idea to actually be taken up by somebody it has to make _sense_ to them. More than that, it also has to be _morally tasteful_ to them. 

> We are unable to accept ideas that we find distasteful. So a large part of philosophy is not just having an idea, but finding a way for that idea to sit well with you. The insignificance of man is not an appealing concept until we reframe it in the context of one universal entity.

One way I've heard this referred to is "The Conceptual Container" \(Jim Collins\). When we take an idea onboard it's often via a metaphor \(the container\) that we personally find intuitive and pleasant \(because of our current beliefs and ideas\) `MetaphorA(Idea)`, we don't ever unpack that idea though. We store the metaphor because human brains really like metaphors. When you go to send the idea to someone else, you'll instinctively go to explain it using that metaphor. 

_// Note, there's more to say here about the container. It's not just what metaphor but the entire "skinning" of the idea, do you explain using emotional language, nature references, logic and mathematics etc. Everyone has their own aesthetic preferences. Even down to the aesthetic of who's saying the damn thing._

This is where we run into trouble. For someone else, that metaphor is probably _not_ intuitive or pleasant. This leads us to believe this person doesn't like the idea itself, which is frustrating because it's a really good idea. The art of convincing someone is to pluck the essence of that idea out of `MetaphorA` and put it into `MetaphorB`, where `MetaphorB` is carefully selected for the intended audience.

This is really hard. To further muddy the waters, it's not even just picking the right metaphor for the right person. The timing also matters. Often an idea only makes sense if we have a chain of beliefs for it to append to, if the recipient is missing any of these beliefs in the chain then it's unlikely that they'll understand our idea _today_. But next year, maybe they've had more conversations and built up the context, now our idea slots in nicely even using _the same metaphor_.

So what's the takeaway here?

When trying to explain something, be mindful of the layers of translation at play. Be mindful of differences in definitions \(a.k.a. the classic debating semantics\). Be mindful of the persons beliefs and preferences for metaphors. Above all, do not blame someone else for not understanding you, it's probably your fault.

Master conversationalists \(of which I am not one\) effortlessly navigate these layers of complexity, carefully monitoring what level of shared understanding the two of you have in a conversation.

There's an even more powerful point here though. I've talked a lot about you being the sender of an idea, what about being the receiver? All this is also true in reverse. If you hear something that doesn't make sense to you, think about what context the speaker must be using to believe it. Consider that if an idea doesn't make sense to you, it's not because you're "stupid" or "can't understand", you're probably just missing some more fundamental concepts and you should come back later. And when you just find an idea a bit icky, even if you think it makes sense logically \(cough, meditation, spirituality, self-love, climate change \(again\)\) then perhaps the container is what's wrong, not the idea itself. Go looking for alternative wordings from other sources and you'll probably find that one perfect version that makes it click for you.

Of course, it's entirely likely that the metaphors and containers I've used in this very article aren't quite the right fit for you. And that's okay, but maybe don't give up on this idea yet ðŸ˜‰.
