# Relaxation

* Listen to the sound of my voice, focus on the details
  * Is it breathy?
  * Nasal?
  * Deep?
* Find your focus: breath
  * Intentionally take a deep breath: in \(count to 5\) and out \(count to 5\) 
  * Repeat 6+ times
* Begin to notice the details of your breath
  * The phases
    * Inhaling
    * Hold
    * Exhaling
    * Hold
  * Feel it in your stomach, chest, shoulders, back, nostrils, throat
* Let your breathing slow 
* Long inhales and exhales
* Imagine your emotional state as an ocean
* The wave and turbulence move in response to your breaths
* As you breath deeper and slower, the ocean's surface becomes calmer and flatter
* Imagine yourself floating upon the waves, weightless and effortless
* Let yourself dissolve into the gentle oscillations of the surface
* All that matters is this coming and going of sensation
* Know that you can always find this place, your anchor, from wherever you are 
* Just take a moment to look for the waves and they will be there
* Sometimes the ocean is choppy, sometimes it even storms
* But it will return to its natural, resting state with time
* Search for the underlying tranquility and it will always be there, even if it is obscured
* Let this be your anchor in life
