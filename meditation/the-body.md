# The Body

* Scan through your body from head to toe, notice the details
  * The top of your head
  * Eyebrows
  * Nose
  * Cheeks
  * Tongue
  * Ears
  * Neck
  * Shoulders
  * Biceps / triceps
  * Forearms
  * Fingers and fingertips
  * Spine
  * Chest
  * Abs
  * Booty
  * Quads
  * Hamstrings
  * Knees
  * Shins
  * Calves
  * Feet
  * Toes
* Now, let it all dissolve into a cloud of sensation
* Is there any discomfort? Any pain? Itchiness? Restlessness?
  * Notice it in detail
  * Don't try and fix it, or judge it
  * Just notice
* Be grateful for your body working so hard
* Think how much we ask of our bodies
  * Walking around
  * Carrying heavy objects
  * Sitting for hours
* Appreciate all your body does for you, and consider what you can do for it
* Think of a good night's sleep as a gift to your body
* The same with a nutritious meal or physical exercise, even stretching
* Your body will be with you for your entire life, it's best to take care of it accordingly
* Now, explore the sensations in your body
* If you find yourself lost in thought, come back to the feeling of your body resting on the floor / chair
