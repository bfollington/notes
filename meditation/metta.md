description: 'A meditation for focusing on love, in the abstract'

# Metta

* Think of someone who's company you enjoy very much
* A simple, uncomplicated relationship 
* What is it you appreciate about them?
* Enumerate the things about them you are grateful for
* Think of the impact they have on your life, the good times
* What are their best qualities? Their most amusing idiosyncrasies?
* Feel the warmth welling up inside of you
* Turn your attention to it, focus on the physical sensations
* This is the _feeling_ of love, it is just as important as the idea
* Reflect on how you want _the best_ for this person
  * You hope all their dreams come true
  * You wish that they are free of suffering, and when suffering does come that they have the resilience and support to face it
  * Imagine their smiling face and feel how happy it makes you
* Repeat this process, cycling through those you care about
  * You can repeat people, circle back to them or focus on just one
* Let yourself smile!



* Now ask yourself, what is it that makes this person or these people so special?
* It is that we know them so deeply, that we appreciate the details of what lies beneath the surface of them
* We can extend this love to _anyone_, if we understand them sufficiently
* Think of someone you have a neutral relationship with, someone who works at your local supermarket, your friendly neighbour
  * Realise that you want the best for this person too
  * Picture them smiling, let yourself wish that their work-day is stress free
* Now, finally, think of someone you find difficult to be around

  * We may never find it within ourselves to truly enjoy this persons company
  * But even for this highly irritating human being, we can wish the best
    * We wish no harm or suffering upon those we dislike
    * I hope they are smiling, surrounded by loved ones somewhere far away from me

* Return to the feeling of warmth in the body, if you've lost focus on it, circle back to someone you care deeply about and find it again
* Imagine the warmth and love inside you slowly expanding and intensifying
* Eventually, it moves beyond the surface of the skin, into the air
* Like a layer of love insulating you, perhaps slightly glowing
* Imagining it growing, and growing
* Include the air, all of us around you, this house, this street, our city... Even the whole planet, or the whole of reality 
* Stretch the limits of how far you can push this, imagine how beautiful it would be for everyone on earth to earnestly smile and feel content



* Meditate on this for as long as you can, be aware of the sensations
* Enumerate the people out there who are deserving of our compassion
* The poor, the sick, the oppressed 
* Feel how much you care for them, despite your paths never crossing
* And now think of the strangers you dislike
* The close minded, selfish, stubborn, bigoted and hateful
* They too deserve our compassion
* They are humans, with just as much depth of experience as ourselves and our loved ones
* And they are hurting, they act out their suffering on others
* But we love them regardless
* Finally, think of yourself
* You are no different to any of these people, you wish yourself the best in life too
* In your head, think the words "I love myself" and let the idea sink in
* Loving ourselves and loving others, there is no difference
  * Two sides of the same coin
* Promise you will be gentler and kinder to yourself



* Now, drop your focus, sit with how you feel
* Freely explore the sensations and thoughts of love that arise without any judgement
* Feel free to explore any of the concepts we've been through, while maintaining awareness of the sensations of love
* Or just sit there and bask
* Keep a gentle smile on your face throughout
