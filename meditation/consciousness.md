# Consciousness

* Object awareness
  * Focus on your object of choice \(the breath, usually\)
  * Move your awareness to other objects, the body, sound, emotion etc.
  * Rotate between objects at a regular but relaxed pace
* Non-choice awareness
  * Try to open yourself up to many of these objects at once
  * When you notice a sound, be aware that you noticed it
  * The same for a breath, a thought, a physical sensation etc.
  * Let the objects draw you to them
* Natural awareness

  * Focus on your entire body
  * Especially the back, feel the enclosed shape of your body 
  * Become aware of all sensations at once
  * Everything you experience, sober or intoxicated, awake or asleep occurs as a perturbation of consciousness 
  * Merely a ripple on its surface
  * Consciousness is like a bubble, containing all of your reality
  * It floats weightlessly and deforms easily, always springing back
  * Let yourself be aware of this, the container of all experience
  * This bubble is not inside your body, or your head, though those objects appear within it
  * It is the sum total of everything 
  * Let the boundaries between you and the universe dissolve
    * They were never there in the first place
  * Your consciousness is expansive, limitless and warm

* Let go of all focus and effort, just be with your consciousness 
* Let go of your beliefs and opinions, they do not define you
* Let go of the pursuit of facts and truth, drop everything and sit in the space that remains
* When we find our awareness, there is no effort, there is no concentration, only relaxed expansiveness
* Sit, and if you once again become identified with thought, gently push your awareness out to encompass everything again
