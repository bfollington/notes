# Remember

1. Your life is not and does not have to be better than everyone else's
2. The life you build is about your own happiness, not being "great" in others' eyes
3. Aim for contentment in the moment and ambition for the future, contentment is not complacency
4. Never be ashamed of liking something because it's outside of your, or anyone else's, taste
5. Always strive to understand others' views even when they contradict your own, there is something to learn from every disagreement
6. Readily accept and enjoy recommendations from others
7. It's okay to love working but not for it to be all encompassing, relax and enjoy the moment
8. If someone doesn't know how to do something, teach them patiently
9. Whenever you are frustrated, consider if it's worthwhile to burn the energy on anger
10. Seek perspective in all things, but don't do anything for the sake of it
11. Set goals and work hard to achieve them, but not to the detriment of yourself
12. Be compassionate and care for others but never put their wellbeing before your own
13. Have faith in humanity
14. Attempt to live an exemplary life
15. Respond, don't react
