# 👋 Hello!

Hi, welcome to my notes.

This is basically a public repository of things I've learned, collected or found interesting enough to write down but that aren't suitable for blog posts. None of this is presented as fact or even recommendation, merely my personal thought processes and interests. This is all a perpetual work-in-progress, I'm attempting to be raw and learn openly.

Broadly, you'll find here:

* Philosophy, in the "how to live a good life" sense
* Emotional wellbeing
* Meditation 
* Programming
* Video Games
* How to get shit done
* Efficiency
* Minimalism
* Essentialism
* Art and creation
* Health
* Exercise
* General scientific inquiry

These resources are part of my effort to be healthy, happy, skilled and caring person. I provide no guarantees they will do any of that, but there's a chance.

Please let me know of anything you think I might like after poking around here 😁
