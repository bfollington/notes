# Path

All my life people have tried to tell me the way to do everything. Like there's no alternative to walking the well-worn path. I decided a long time ago, I'm going to do it all my own way.

No fucking people over, no pursuit of status. Just real stuff made with love. If that doesn't work then I don't want to do it at all.
